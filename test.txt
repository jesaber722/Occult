Steganography (/ˌstɛɡəˈnɒɡrəfi/ (About this soundlisten) STEG-ə-NOG-rə-fee) is the practice of concealing a message
within another message or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video
is concealed within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography comes from Greek steganographia,
which combines the words steganós (στεγανός), meaning "covered or concealed", and -graphia (γραφή) meaning "writing".[1]

The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography
and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or to be part of)
something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in
invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a shared
secret are forms of security through obscurity, and key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to Kerckhoffs's
principle.[2]

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention
to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse
interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.[3]
